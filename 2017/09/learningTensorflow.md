## Learning Tensorflow source code

### Overview
On the tensorflow website there are different sections for learning Tensorflow. 
It covers how to use Tensorflow to develop your code. But the section on [Extending](https://www.tensorflow.org/extend/adding_an_op) an Op in Tensorflow is brief. **Please refer the doc before proceeding**. 
I am covering for CPU kernels now. I will do for GPU's as an when I will learn.

It covers the main steps:
1. Register the new op in a C++ file:
