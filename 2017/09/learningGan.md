## Learning Generative Adversarial Networks

### Prerequisites
[For introduction and use cases of GANs](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/06/introductory-generative-adversarial-networks-gans/)
[For detailed explanation and code](https://wiseodd.github.io/techblog/2016/09/17/gan-tensorflow/)

Some problems that GAN suffers is the lack of spatial orientations and relevance to the real world as there are examples where a dog has 3-4 eyes which do not happen in the real world, also, lack of three-dimensional orientation. GAN suffers from these defects because the function it tries to optimise is based on the goal to maximise likelihood of detecting a real image(class 1) with high confidence and a fake image with
