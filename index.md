## Introduction
I have created this blog with the intention to document my learning towards Deep Learning and AI in general. I will be posting as an when I learn something so that if there is a newbie like me in this area, he/she can refer it and learn at a much faster pace. It will also serve as my way to document my learning in the subject. I do have some level of understanding of Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning. So, this blog won't start from basics, moreover, there are many blogs that have covered basics of both the subjects.
